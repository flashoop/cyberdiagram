## FAQ Responses

**Q: How is this different from traditional penetration testing?**
A: Traditional pentests are point-in-time assessments that cost $15,000-50,000+ and quickly become outdated. CyberDiagram provides continuous, automated testing at a fraction of the cost, with visual reporting that makes findings immediately actionable.

**Q: Why focus on SMEs instead of enterprises?**
A: SMEs represent 99% of businesses but have been priced out of effective security testing. They face the same threats as large companies but lack the budgets and expertise. We're democratizing access to enterprise-grade security.

**Q: What makes your AI approach effective?**
A: Our AI models are trained on 20 years of real-world penetration testing experience, including insights from securing massive cloud platforms at Huawei and Alibaba. We don't just find vulnerabilities—we map realistic attack paths that matter to your business.

**Q: How long until I see value?**
A: Initial scans complete within hours of connecting your cloud accounts. You'll receive your first visual security assessment within 24 hours, with ongoing monitoring from day one.
